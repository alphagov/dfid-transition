The trials were established in a randomized complete block design with four replications to assess genotype performance and Genotype × Environment interaction for cassava mosaic disease (CMD), fresh and dry root yield (FYLD; DYLD), root dry matter content (DMC), and total carotene concentration (TCC). Combined analysis of variance showed significant differences ( &amp;amp;#55349;&amp;amp;#56387; &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 ) among genotypes (G), environment (E), and Genotype × Environment interaction (GE) for all the traits tested. For reaction to CMD, the best genotypes showing stable resistance were TMS 07/0539 and TMS 07/0628. For root yield, the best genotypes were TMS 01/1368 and TMS 07/0553. Genotype TMS 07/0593 was the best for DMC and TCC across the 10 environments. Variation among genotypes accounted for most of the Total Sum of Squares for CMD (72.1%) and TCC (34.4%). Environmental variation accounted for most of the Total Sum of Squares for FYLD (42.8%), DYLD (39.6%), and DMC (29.2%). This study revealed that TMS 07/0593 has the highest and most stable TCC, DMC with the lowest CMD severity score and appeared to be the best genotype. " } ,

Following these main chapters the document contains three important appendices. The first contains a series of illustrated guides to key construction issues for the RRDST pavement options. The second highlights some fundamental issues relating to site supervision and construction quality control, whilst the third contains a series of standard site forms developed and used during the RRST construction phases.
